            I am an American living in Nagasaki, Japan since 2016. I have 6
            years of experience in both front end/full stack development and the
            translation/provision of multilingual contents through work in the
            Japanese IT industry. My specializations are in ESC6 (JavaScript),
            Python, Linux (CENTOS), and the translation and localization of web
            and marketing contents. I also have experience in Japanese to
            English interpretation and legal translation, as well as technical
            writing and market research.
          </p>

            I gain enjoyment from work when I get the chance to collaborate with
            people and find new opportunities. Solving problems is one of the
            most satisfying aspects of programming and product creation to me,
            and I value using front end/full stack development for the ability
            to create a visible result.
